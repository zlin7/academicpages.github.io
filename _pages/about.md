I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, supervised by [Jimeng Sun](http://sunlab.org/). 
My current research interest is in developing interepretable and reliable deep learning models for healthcare problems.


I started at UIUC in Aug 2020. Previously, I received my bachelor's degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics from UChicago in 2018.
